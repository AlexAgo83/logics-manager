# Context
- Derived from backlog item `item_337_simplify_corpus_map_structure`.
- Source file: `logics/backlog/item_337_simplify_corpus_map_structure.md`.
- Related request(s): `req_187_improve_corpus_map_readability`.
- Make the corpus relationship map readable at a glance in Logics Insights.
- Reduce visual clutter from overlapping labels, dense edges, and repeated counts.
- Keep the overview useful without forcing the user to parse the full graph.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Confirm scope, dependencies, and linked acceptance criteria.
- [ ] 2. Implement the next coherent delivery wave from the backlog item.
- [ ] 3. Checkpoint the wave in a commit-ready state, validate it, and update the linked Logics docs.
- [ ] CHECKPOINT: leave the current wave commit-ready and update the linked Logics docs before continuing.
- [ ] CHECKPOINT: if the shared AI runtime is active and healthy, run `python logics/skills/logics.py flow assist commit-all` for the current step, item, or wave commit checkpoint.
- [ ] GATE: do not close a wave or step until the relevant automated tests and quality checks have been run successfully.
- [ ] FINAL: Update related Logics docs

# Delivery checkpoints
- Each completed wave should leave the repository in a coherent, commit-ready state.
- Update the linked Logics docs during the wave that changes the behavior, not only at final closure.
- Prefer a reviewed commit checkpoint at the end of each meaningful wave instead of accumulating several undocumented partial states.
- If the shared AI runtime is active and healthy, use `python logics/skills/logics.py flow assist commit-all` to prepare the commit checkpoint for each meaningful step, item, or wave.
- Do not mark a wave or step complete until the relevant automated tests and quality checks have been run successfully.

# AC Traceability
- AC1 -> Scope: The request clearly states that the map must be readable at a glance.. Proof: capture validation evidence in this doc.
- AC2 -> Scope: The request explains that the map should stay an overview and not duplicate all detail from the side panel.. Proof: capture validation evidence in this doc.
- AC3 -> Scope: The request leaves room for a simpler hierarchy, reduced labels, or details-on-demand.. Proof: capture validation evidence in this doc.

# Decision framing
- Product framing: Not needed
- Product signals: (none detected)
- Product follow-up: No product brief follow-up is expected based on current signals.
- Architecture framing: Consider
- Architecture signals: data model and persistence
- Architecture follow-up: Review whether an architecture decision is needed before implementation becomes harder to reverse.

# Validation
- Run the relevant automated tests for the changed surface before closing the current wave or step.
- Run the relevant lint or quality checks before closing the current wave or step.
- Confirm the completed wave leaves the repository in a commit-ready state.

# Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Scope implemented and acceptance criteria covered.
- [ ] Validation commands executed and results captured.
- [ ] No wave or step was closed before the relevant automated tests and quality checks passed.
- [ ] Linked request/backlog/task docs updated during completed waves and at closure.
- [ ] Each completed wave left a commit-ready checkpoint or an explicit exception is documented.
- [ ] Status is `Done` and progress is `100%`.
